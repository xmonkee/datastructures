Problem 1 - Binary Search in mulitple arrays
Author: Mayank Mandava

Files: 
   structures.h : data types and function prototypes
   structures.c : the datastructur functions - init, search and destroy
   run.c : reads the arrays file, runs the random searches, outputs the results

Compilation: gcc *.c -o p1.o

Usage: The program, without any arguments, will provide running instructions
Typical Usage: ./p1.o arrayfile number-of-searches [outputfile]

Notes: The program leaves it up to the user the supply the input array file and the number of random searches to run on the datastructures. It will output the stats about running time and space usage of each strucutre on the screen and optionally save the output of each search in a file. Running the program will provide the usaage instructions. It expects the input arrays to the in the same format as supplied by the instructors.
