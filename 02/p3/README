Problem 3 - Verifying BST
Author: Mayank Mandava

Compilation: make
/lib/libtree.a : library containing isBST and isBST_recursive
/bin/test: executable to test functions on a small tree

Files: 
   stack.c: generic stack structure used for non-recursive isBST
   tnw.c: Tree node wrapper structure. Used in conjunction with the stack to keep track of interval limits for each subtree
   tree.c: The verification functions isBST(Tree_node * tree) and isBST_recursive(Tree_node * tree). Debugging can be enabled in tree.h to get display of the stack usage. 
   test.c: Optional test code for the verification functions.
