1. Consider the shortest path problem for a directed, weighted graph
G(E,V).  We learned that Dijkstra's algorithm finds the distance between
any source node S and all other nodes in the graph in O(|V|^2)
operations. A similar problem, the all-source shortest path problem, finds
the minimum distance between EACH vertex v in a graph and all other
vertices.

a) Write a code that solves the all source shortest path problem by
simplying applying Dijkstra n = |V| times, i.e. once for each vertex
in G.  Note that this algorithm has complexity n^3.

b) Next write a shared memory parallel version of (a) using OpenMP.
Your strategy will be straightforward -- simply assign a different
source vertex to each core. Assume n > p, where p is the number of
processors (i.e.  cores) on a multicore machine. What is the
complexity of the parallel algorithm in terms of n and p? Compare the
performance of the serial and parallel approach using the provided
sample graph. Comment briefly on the observed timings.

2. Next, consider how you might use a shared memory parallel processor
to accelerate Dijskstra *within* a single source computation? There
are several possible approaches, and developing a reasonable approach
yourself (doesn't have to be optimal) is part of the exercise. In this
case, to guide your thinking you may assume that n is much larger than
p -- i.e there are many more vertices than cores. Consider ways to
partition the graph among processors to minmize contention and load
balance -- ie to keep all cores busy but require minimum
synchronization.

a) write pseudocode to describe your approach
b) implement the psuedocode in C/OpenMP

Note that you get 50% credit for just the psuedo-code -- ie a
non-trivial part of the exercise involves developing a reasonable
approach.
